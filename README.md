# change-claude-web-profile
Are you tired of claude.ai's annoying default purple or brown avatar? Anthropic has stated they will not open the feature for users to upload their own avatars, so come use this Tampermonkey script to replace it!

Use a Tampermonkey script to replace Claude.ai's annoying purple name abbreviation avatar with your custom avatar, and change the email on the homepage to your name.

# How to use?
Copy main.js into your Tampermonkey, enable the script, then open Claude.ai, click on the script settings option in Tampermonkey, set your avatar (Base64) and name, refresh the page, and you're done! It's that simple.
